A game engine/renderer made from vulkan

## Build Instructions (Windows with Visual Studio)

- clone recursively
- open with visual studio
- set complier to clang
- navigate to CMakeSettings.json and set Vulkan location (install vulkan at https://vulkan.lunarg.com/)
- and done!

It should run now unless I've broken something
